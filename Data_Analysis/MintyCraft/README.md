## Phase 1
Develop a Proof of Concept (POC) for an AI-powered financial bot that accepts datasets or Excel sheets containing company financial information, including expenditure patterns. The bot should generate graphical representations that provide valuable insights from the data. These insights should include the most active spending days, departmental spending distributions, billing, HR sales, and peak spending days. Additionally, the bot should identify customer demographics and their interactions with specific departments. The Python programming language will be utilized for the development of this code.

We will use this dataset from Kaggle for the proof of concept of this financial bot, which includes the company's profit data and expenditures.
